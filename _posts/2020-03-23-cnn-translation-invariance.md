## Hypothesis
~~We have empirically observed that CNNs are translation invariant.~~ It is common assumption that CNNs are translation invariant. But CNNs can and will exploit absolute location by learning filters which respond to image bourndaries. This exploitation can be observed far from the image boundary because of the large filter sizes of modern/large CNNs.
